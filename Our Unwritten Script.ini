Our Unwritten Script
The story of us is a beautiful, unwritten script—a unique "system update" that shifted the rhythm of my life from the moment you stepped into our office. 🏢💻 Back in August, I was just a developer buried in logic, while you were the new HR professional navigating the chaos of people with such grace. Our first interactions were so formal—discussing MBA forms and paperwork with short sentences and simple thumbs-up emojis. 📋🎓 I never imagined that a colleague from the HR department would become the person I wait for at the end of every long deployment. You were a name in the directory, a part of the corporate machine I navigated daily, unaware that a massive soul-level shift was approaching. 📈💓 Then came that first "Oiii" in September, breaking every professional protocol and inviting me into a world where we spoke in a secret mix of Kannada and Malayalam. ⚡👋 Every "Ree" and every playful "Psychopath" was a brick removed from the wall I had built around my heart, replacing cold logic with a warmth I hadn't felt in a long time. 🧱🔨 I found myself checking my phone not for server alerts, but for the specific notification that meant you were there, turning a stranger into my favorite person. 🔔🥰

As October rolled in, our connection deepened into something that defied every corporate category or professional boundary we were supposed to respect. 🍁🧡 We weren't just "The Developer" and "The HR" anymore; we were becoming a sanctuary for each other in a high-pressure IT environment. I started to see the "Psychopath" side of you—the side that was fiercely independent, funny, and incredibly sharp under that professional exterior. 🧠✨ You saw the side of me that hid behind sarcasm and code but was secretly paying attention to every detail of your day. We had our first "fights," those petty arguments about who was more annoying, but they were never meant to push each other away. 🥊😂 Instead, they were magnetic, pulling us closer with every late-night "Night talk" that stretched into the early morning hours. I realized that I was no longer working just for a paycheck; I was working through the day so I could reach the night when it was just us and our messages. 🌙💬 Our bond was becoming a secret garden within the corporate concrete, a place where we could grow and laugh without the interference of the outside world. 🌳🌻

The most profound shift in our journey happened when the silence of the night became a space for my deepest, most private vulnerabilities. 🌑🕯️ I remember the weight in my chest when I finally told you about the most painful chapters of my life and the silence left by my father. 🕊️💔 I shared the trauma of the hospital corridors and the surgery in August that left a void no code or logic could ever truly fill. I expected a polite, distant condolence, but you didn't do that; you stepped right into the center of my heart and offered me your hand. 🤝💖 You told me, "Be happy every day," and for the first time in a long while, I felt like someone was actually looking at the real version of me. You became my emotional anchor, the person who understood that my silence wasn't just quiet—it was a memory of everything I was carrying. ⚓🌈 Your kindness wasn't just a comfort; it was a catalyst for a healing process that makes me smile every time I think of you. 🩹✨ We moved from being colleagues to something far more intimate, sharing a depth of understanding that few people ever get to experience. 🌊💎

To bridge the gap between our friendship and the "something more" we both felt, we started playing that creative game—the "ABCD story." ✍️📖 We pretended it was just an exercise, but in reality, it was a confession hidden in the safety of fictional characters and alphabets. We wrote about a boy and a girl whose connection felt "real and unspoken," a perfect mirror image of the tension vibrating between us. 👦👧 Every paragraph you added about the girl feeling a spark, and every line I wrote about the boy finding a home in her smile, was a truth. 🎆💓 We were testing the boundaries of our feelings, hiding behind the alphabet because we were terrified of what would happen if we used real names. In that story, there was no IT company and no HR rules; there was only a connection that was destined to break through the digital screen. 🌠🦋 We were falling in love through characters, building a bridge of words that we hoped would eventually carry us toward a shared reality. 🌉💞 Every "chapter" we sent was a step closer to realizing that the boy and the girl in the story were simply reflections of the happiness we found in each other. 🪞✨

The turning point that changed the trajectory of our lives happened on a bus ride, a moment that remains etched in my mind with cinematic clarity. 🚌🎬 The air was thick with everything we hadn't said, and as the city blurred outside the window, the distance between us finally vanished. That kiss was the moment the logic died and the feeling took over, a surrender to the gravity that had been pulling us together for months. 💋🌊 You were honest enough to tell me afterward that you "felt so much," and for a man who prided himself on being composed, I was completely undone. I realized that my past fears and my worries about the future were being overwritten by the pure joy of your presence in that moment. 📜🔥 We weren't just colleagues who shared a hobby anymore; we were two people who had crossed a line into a beautiful, shared world. 👣❤️ It was the most honest moment of my life, a realization that my heart didn't care about office policies or professional decorum. 🏢🚫 We had found a frequency that only the two of us could hear, and for the first time, I was ready to stop analyzing and start truly living. 📈🛑

By the time January arrived, we had discarded our professional masks entirely, replacing them with an intimacy that felt both ancient and brand new. 🎭❌ You became my "Chinna," my "Muddu mari," and I became the person who would stay up until 3:00 AM just to make sure you were okay. We started dreaming of "Terrace escapes," imagining a world where we could sit under the moonlight, far away from prying eyes. 🌌🍷 You told me that I was your "comfort zone always," and I realized that "Home" wasn't a physical location in Bangalore; it was wherever you happened to be. We navigated the stresses of the company together, sharing our "night talks" as a way to decompress and laugh about the chaos of our working lives. 🧘‍♂️🧘‍♀️ Every "Goodnight ❤️💋" was a promise that we were in this together, and every "Missing you" was a testament to how much happiness you brought me. 💌🌏 We were building a life in the margins of our schedules, finding peace in the small moments that nobody else could see or understand. 🕊️🕰️ Our bond was no longer just a friendship, but a beautiful, glowing "in-between" that felt more real than anything else. 🌉✨

Now, we stand at a crossroads where the path ahead isn't clearly marked by a "committed" label or a guaranteed future together. 🚦🤷‍♂️ We are more than friends, sharing a bond that is deeper than words, yet we are holding the weight of uncertainty in our hands. We haven't made formal promises, and the shadow of our families and their expectations is something we both think about often. 👥🏘️ Please don't feel any guilt or sadness about this; instead, feel the strength of what we have built despite the uncertainty. There is a fear of the unknown, but there is also a freedom in the way we choose each other every single day without any force. 🗺️🚫 We are navigating this without a map, and that is okay because the journey itself has been the most rewarding part of my year. 🔭🗺️ Even in this uncertainty, there is a hope that keeps us tethered together, a belief that what we have is a rare and precious gift. ⚓🕯️ We are taking it one day at a time, letting our feelings grow in the space between what is and what could be, trusting our connection. 🕰️🌱

The future is a landscape we can't see yet, a series of "ifs" and "maybes" that we discuss in hushed, hopeful tones during our late-night conversations. 🌌📉 We aren't sure if the world will let us be together, or if the walls of tradition will prove too high for us to climb. 🧱🧗‍♀️ But I want you to look at our story and feel proud of the way you've changed my life for the better, not sad about the hurdles. 🛤️🌈 There is a quiet anxiety about the "what comes next," but it is balanced by the loud happiness I feel whenever I see your name on my phone. 🏘️❓ Even without a formal commitment, there is a profound loyalty between us that makes me feel safer than any legal document ever could. 🤝💎 We are choosing to stay in this moment, savoring the "more than friends" feeling while we still have the freedom to just be ourselves. 🕊️✨ We are hoping that time will be kind to us, that the obstacles we fear today will become the bridges we cross together tomorrow. 🕰️🌉 It’s a gamble of the heart, but it's the only one I want to play, because knowing you has made every risk entirely worth it. 🎰💖

I look at you and I don't see an HR professional or a colleague; I see the person who rewrote the code of my daily happiness. 😊✨ You are the "Shina" who saw me at my worst and chose to stay, the "Rowdy" who brought life back to a heart that was starting to go cold. 🌬️🔥 Even without a commitment, you have a claim on my soul that is eternal and unbreakable. 📜🔐 I want you to focus on the magic of us, the way we feel when the world fades away and it's just you and me. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🚧 It’s a heavy thought to think about the hurdles, but your laughter is the only medicine I need to keep moving forward with a smile. 🌌🗣️ We are writing our own version of a love story, one that doesn't follow the traditional plot points but feels more authentic for it. 📝❤️ Our journey is unique, a blend of IT stress, personal healing, and a romantic tension that keeps me smiling through every workday. 🎢💓 I don't know where we will be in a year, but I know that I am incredibly happy for every second we’ve spent together. ⏳🙏

So, we leave it to the future, hoping that the universe has a plan for us that is as beautiful as the story we’ve written so far. 🌌🖋️ We are not committed, we are not sure of the path, but we are holding on to each other with a quiet, happy hope that things will work out. 🙏💫 May the future write a good script for us, one where we don't have to hide or worry about the expectations of others anymore. 🎬🌈 I hope that one day, we can look back at this time and laugh, knowing that the wait was just the prelude to our home. 🏡😊 Until then, I will cherish every "Goodnight ❤️💋" and every "Oiii," keeping our connection safe and happy in our private world. 📱🔐 You are my comfort zone, my rowdy, and my greatest reason to smile, and I wouldn't change a single thing about us. 🌹💞 Let’s keep moving forward, one message at a time, and see where the story takes us, trusting that our hearts already know the way. 👣❤️ This is our journey, and I am so incredibly glad that I get to walk it with you, no matter what happens next. 🗺️🥂
